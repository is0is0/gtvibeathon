## 📦 What Was Built

### **Complete Multi-Agent 3D Scene & Animation Generation System**

A production-ready AI-powered framework that orchestrates 6 specialized agents to autonomously create sophisticated 3D scenes and cinematic animations in Blender from natural language prompts.

---

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### **1. Multi-Model Scene Generation**
- **10-20+ objects** per scene with proper organization
- **ALL Blender modifiers** (Array, Bevel, Boolean, Subdivision, Mirror, Screw, etc.)
- **Complex geometry** (curves, mesh operations, instancing)
- **Hierarchical collections** for scene organization

### **2. Advanced Material System**
- **50+ shader nodes** fully utilized
- **Procedural textures** (Noise, Voronoi, Wave, Magic, Musgrave, etc.)
- **Complex node networks** with layering and mixing
- **PBR, emission, glass, subsurface scattering** materials
- **Bump and normal mapping** for detail

### **3. Cinematic Animation (NEW)**
- **5-10+ animated objects** with varied techniques
- **ALL easing types** (Bezier, Sine, Bounce, Elastic, Expo, etc.)
- **Professional easing modes** (EASE_IN, EASE_OUT, EASE_IN_OUT)
- **Camera animation** for dynamic cinematography
- **Material animation** (colors, emission, properties)
- **F-Curve modifiers** and constraints
- **180 frames @ 24fps** default (cinematic quality)

### **4. Complete Pipeline**
```
Prompt → Concept → Builder → Texture → Render → Animation → Execution → Review
```

## 🎯 Next Steps to Use

### **1. Configure Environment**
```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add:
# - Your API key (Anthropic or OpenAI)
# - Blender path for your system
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install
pip install -e .
```

### **3. Verify Setup**
```bash
# Check configuration
voxel config-check
```

### **4. Generate Your First Scene**
```bash
# Static multi-object scene
voxel create "a cozy cyberpunk cafe with tables, chairs, neon signs, and decorations"

# Animated scene
voxel create "floating islands with waterfalls, camera orbiting around them"
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple** - Test with basic prompts first
2. **Use EEVEE** - Faster renders for iteration
3. **Lower samples** - 64-128 for testing, 256+ for final
4. **Disable review** - Faster generation with `--no-review`
5. **Check scripts** - Review generated code in `output/*/scripts/`
6. **Open .blend files** - Explore scenes in Blender GUI
